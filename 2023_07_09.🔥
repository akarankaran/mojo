### let and var experiments
## there is one variable, you can not assign that variable to something else
# variable will not change its memory address after its assigned.
# working
let a = 5
c = 5

# not working
let a = 5
a = c 


### Type checking
# working
a = 5
let a: Int = 50

# not working
a = 5
let a: String = '50'

# working
a = 5
let a: StringLiteral = 'ab'

# works
let a:Int = 5
let a = 5
a = 5
let a:StringLiteral = '5'
var a:Int = 5

# not working
a:StringLiteral = '5'
a = '5'
a:Int = '5'
a:Int = 5

# not able to convert to StringLiteral
def myf(a:Int, b:StringLiteral):
    return b + StringLiteral(a)

print(myf(5, 'karan'))
